This is a simple full-stack web application that allows users to browse and search for movies. The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

> This may take 1-2 minutes to load on first render since I'm using free-plan of onrender to host our backend server. It goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity.
